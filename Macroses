### Macros scripts

1) Script to filter countries from the downloaded data according to my own country list of 157 states.

Sub Find_Matches()
    Dim CompareRange As Variant, x As Variant, y As Variant
    
    Set CompareRange = Range("F2:F158")
   
    For Each x In Selection
        For Each y In CompareRange
            If x = y Then x.Offset(0, 1) = 0
        Next y
    Next x
End Sub


2) Script to find duplications and delete them.

Sub HighlightMatches()
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    
    Dim var As Variant, iSheet As Integer, iRow As Long, iRowL As Long, bln As Boolean
       
       iRowL = Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
       
       For iRow = 1 To iRowL
            
          If bln = False Then
             Cells(iRow, 1).Font.Bold = False
             Else
             Cells(iRow, 1).Clear
          End If
          
       Next iRow
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
